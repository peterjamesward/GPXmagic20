# GPXmagic hits 2.0

It's time to throw out all the cruft of 1.0.

Start afresh with:

* New data structures for Graph, Route, everything.

* Properly designed algebraic operations on these structures.

* Mutiple views.

* Progressive rendering for large routes.

* Re-organised tools (but how?).

* Regret-free code base.

* 3D geometry all the way, with proper types and conversions.

* More modularity (no multi-thousand line source files, maybe).

Still Elm, apart from the mapbox interface and OAuth support, which carry over.
