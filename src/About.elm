## 2.4.16 update 2021-10-24

- Reverse track applies between markers, or whole track if no purple marker.

- Adjusted elevation in 1st person view to reduce the road obscuring the view in descents.

- Added gradient display in 1st person, effective only during Flythrough.

- Adjusted gradient colouring, more in line with other tools.

- Much better handling of SVG files output from InkScape (handles scale and matrix transforms).

## Can I support this work?

**YES, PLEASE!!**

Donations will be passed on to our local hospice.
We have changed to "Buy Me a Coffee" as a payment provider.
Use the not so subtle yellow button at the top.

## Guidance on use

Load a local GPX file by clicking on the aptly-labelled button.

Or connect to Strava by clicking on the equally-apt brand-compliant button and
authorize GPXmagic to access your routes. You can then paste in a URL for a
Strava route and get the GPX by clicking "Fetch route".
The Strava connection is valid for six hours.

**Remember to save your changes often.**
The Save button writes to your download folder only (this is a security limitation of browsers).

## Source code

v2 source code is open-source. See https://github.com/peterjamesward/GPXmagic20

## Legally required notices

Compatible with Strava, for the purpose of loading route and segment data.

Your IP address may be logged for the purpose of aggregate usage recording; no personal details are stored.

No cookies are used, though many chocolate digestives were consumed whilst writing.
