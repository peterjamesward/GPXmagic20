## 2.7.7 update 2021-11-22

- Don't remove "foldbacks" on load if your name is Dan.

- New slider in Visual Options allows you to reduce the graphics level, which may improve
performance for routes with many track points. It will render all trackpoints close to the
Orange marker, but reduced this to a quarter beyond a certain distance. Increasing the reduction
(slider to the right) reduces the area of full detail. Zero disables this feature. On many tracks
you will not notice a difference.

- Gradient Problems slider goes down to 1%.

Don't worry, it's all possible with the Interthingy.
Use the not so subtle yellow button at the top.
Donations will be passed on to our local hospice.

## Guidance on use

Load a local GPX file by clicking on the thus-labelled button.

Or connect to Strava by clicking on the equally-apt brand-compliant button and
authorize GPXmagic to access your routes. You can then paste in a URL for a
Strava route and get the GPX by clicking "Fetch route".
The Strava connection is valid for six hours.

**Remember to save your changes often.**
The Save button writes to your download folder only (this is a security limitation of browsers).

## Source code

v2 source code is open-source. See https://github.com/peterjamesward/GPXmagic20

## Legally required notices

Compatible with Strava, for the purpose of loading route and segment data.

Your IP address may be logged for the purpose of aggregate usage recording; no personal details are stored.

No cookies are used, though many chocolate digestives were consumed whilst writing.
