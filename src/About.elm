## 2.3.1 update 2021-10-04

- You can select your own Favourite tools by clicking on the star. Blue stars denote the Favourites.
If you then click on "Show Starred and Open only", all other tools will be hidden. Favourite tools,
whether Open or Closed, will be listed above the non-favourites.

- Yes, it seems more complicated. If you liked things as they were, don't click on the Stars. If you
like to work with a subset of tools, Star them. The tool settings will (in most cases) be preserved
even between sessions.

- Please see video at https://youtu.be/3eRFRLgkF8I for illustration.

## Can I support this work?

**YES, PLEASE!!**

Donations will be passed on to our local hospice.
We have changed to "Buy Me a Coffee" as a payment provider.
Use the not so subtle yellow button at the top.

## Guidance on use

Load a local GPX file by clicking on the aptly-labelled button.

Or connect to Strava by clicking on the equally-apt brand-compliant button and
authorize GPXmagic to access your routes. You can then paste in a URL for a
Strava route and get the GPX by clicking "Fetch route".
The Strava connection is valid for six hours.

**Remember to save your changes often.**
The Save button writes to your download folder only (this is a security limitation of browsers).

## Source code

v2 source code is open-source. See https://github.com/peterjamesward/GPXmagic20

## Legally required notices

Compatible with Strava, for the purpose of loading route and segment data.

Your IP address may be logged for the purpose of aggregate usage recording; no personal details are stored.

No cookies are used, though many chocolate digestives were consumed whilst writing.
