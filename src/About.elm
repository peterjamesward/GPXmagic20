    """## Thank you for trying GPXmagic.
    GPXmagic is freely provided without warranty.

## 2.2.1 update 2021-09-01

- TipJar replaced by "Buy Me A Coffee" button, because [insert reason here].
- Bezier approximation should now respect Orange and Purple markers,
so that it applies between the markers and does not randomly move them.

## Donations

**YES, PLEASE!!**

Donations will be passed on to our local hospice.
Use the not so subtle yellow button at the top.

## Guidance on use

Load a local GPX file by clicking on the aptly-labelled button.

Or connect to Strava by clicking on the equally-apt brand-compliant button and
authorize GPXmagic to access your routes. You can then paste in a URL for a
Strava route and get the GPX by clicking "Fetch route".
The Strava connection is valid for six hours.

**Remember to save your changes often.**
The Save button writes to your download folder only (this is a security limitation of browsers).

## Source code

v2 source code is open-source. See https://github.com/peterjamesward/GPXmagic20

## Legally required notices

Compatible with Strava, for the purpose of loading route and segment data.

Your IP address is logged for the purpose of aggregate usage recording; no personal details are stored.

No cookies are used.
