{-| Utility library to manage client-side OAuth 2.0 authentications

The library contains a main OAuth module exposing types used accross other modules. In practice,
you'll only need tu use one of the additional modules:

  - OAuth.AuthorizationCode: The authorization code grant type is used to obtain both access tokens
    and refresh tokens via a redirection-based flow and is optimized for confidential clients
    [4.1](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-4.1).

  - OAuth.AuthorizationCode.PKCE: An extension of the original OAuth 2.0 specification to mitigate
    authorization code interception attacks through the use of Proof Key for Code Exchange (PKCE).

  - OAuth.Implicit: The implicit grant type is used to obtain access tokens (it does not support the
    issuance of refresh tokens) and is optimized for public clients known to operate a particular
    redirection URI [4.2](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-4.2).

  - OAuth.Password: The resource owner password credentials grant type is suitable in cases where the
    resource owner has a trust relationship with the client, such as the device operating system or a
    highly privileged application [4.3](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-4.3)

  - OAuth.ClientCredentials: The client can request an access token using only its client credentials
    (or other supported means of authentication) when the client is requesting access to the protected
    resources under its control, or those of another resource owner that have been previously arranged
    with the authorization server (the method of which is beyond the scope of this specification)
    [4.4](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-4.3).

In practice, you most probably want to use the _OAuth.Implicit_ module which is the most commonly
used.

{-| Describes the type of access token to use.

  - Bearer: Utilized by simply including the access token string in the request
    [rfc6750](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6750)

  - Mac: Not supported.

-}
useToken : Token -> List Http.Header -> List Http.Header
useToken token =
    (::) (Http.header "Authorization" (tokenToString token))


{-| Create a token from two string representing a token type and
an actual token value. This is intended to be used in Json decoders
or Query parsers.

Returns `Nothing` when the token type is `Nothing`
, different from `Just "Bearer"` or when there's no token at all.

-}
makeToken : Maybe TokenType -> Maybe TokenString -> Maybe Token
makeToken =
    Maybe.andThen2 tryMakeToken


{-| See `makeToken`, with the subtle difference that a token value may or
may not be there.

Returns `Nothing` when the token type isn't `"Bearer"`.

Returns `Just Nothing` or `Just (Just token)` otherwise, depending on whether a token is
present or not.

{-| Describes an OAuth error response [4.1.2.1](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-4.1.2.1)

  - InvalidRequest: The request is missing a required parameter, includes an invalid parameter value,
    includes a parameter more than once, or is otherwise malformed.

  - UnauthorizedClient: The client is not authorized to request an authorization code using this
    method.

  - AccessDenied: The resource owner or authorization server denied the request.

  - UnsupportedResponseType: The authorization server does not support obtaining an authorization code
    using this method.

  - InvalidScope: The requested scope is invalid, unknown, or malformed.

  - ServerError: The authorization server encountered an unexpected condition that prevented it from
    fulfilling the request. (This error code is needed because a 500 Internal Server Error HTTP status
    code cannot be returned to the client via an HTTP redirect.)

  - TemporarilyUnavailable: The authorization server is currently unable to handle the request due to
    a temporary overloading or maintenance of the server. (This error code is needed because a 503
    Service Unavailable HTTP status code cannot be returned to the client via an HTTP redirect.)

  - Custom: Encountered a 'free-string' or custom code not specified by the official RFC but returned
    by the authorization server.
