**Graph** - the thing that kicked it all off. 
_DONE_ a) Applying edits to canonical graph.
_DONE_ b) Turning it back into a route.

c) DSL for re-routing (including turn-arounds ??).
d) Radius bends at nodes using 3D smoother.

-- 2.1.0 ships here --

Flythrough respects any azimuth & elevation applied when stationery.

Terrain. Perhaps with quadtree.

**New bend smoother filter** - four point external centroid (convex only, not 'S').

New tool to **limit gradients** (range or whole track), retaining elevation of marked points.
(There are options. None are perfect, but we can be easier to use than competition.)

One useful elevation tab tool might be the ability to apply a slope difference to a range of points.

Working offline?

Beware bounding box on tracks crossing the international date line !!
