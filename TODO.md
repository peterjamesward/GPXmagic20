Wacky splines with tight tolerance?

Gradient limit with no markers => whole track

Check all edits for old logic

Disable limit button if no solution

Upgrade logging?

# TODO

? New bend smoother filter - four point external centroid (convex only, not 'S').

With Quadtree, **LIDAR** may be possible. 
(Assuming we leave the data acquisition to the user?)

Flythrough to respect any azimuth & elevation applied when stationery.

One useful elevation tab tool might be the ability to apply a slope difference to a range of points.

Working offline? (Mongoose server?)

Sun should be in the North at southern latitudes. Could make it moveable. Idle waste of time.
