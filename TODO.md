# BUGS

Upgrade logging?

Common track splitter for all edits - return three segments (prior, active, after).

# TODO

? New bend smoother filter - four point external centroid (convex only, not 'S').

With Quadtree, **LIDAR** may be possible. 
(Assuming we leave the data acquisition to the user?)

Flythrough to respect any azimuth & elevation applied when stationery.

One useful elevation tab tool might be the ability to apply a slope difference to a range of points.

Working offline? (Mongoose server?)

Sun should be in the North at southern latitudes. Could make it moveable. Idle waste of time.
