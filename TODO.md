STUFF FOR STEVE

    Track combiner:
        Appends new track (from local file only) to current
    
    Batch operation:
        1. Define list of (whole track) operations
        2. Apply over directory
        3. Appends if possible when less than theshold distance remains.

Consider colouring TP by curvature.
This may lead to way of identifying (e.g.) sweeping bends, straights, hairpins.
That might then lead to more intelligent automated smoothing, specialised by region.

Strava segment blend elevation rather than just Paste (optional).

? Flythrough to respect any azimuth & elevation applied when stationery.

"One useful elevation tab tool might be the ability to apply a slope difference to a range of points."
(I don't understand this suggestion.)
