> 2.1.0 ships here?

**Nudge** with a variable size brush, with damping.
Visible by the preview, where we see a "fade" back to the normal track.

**Centroid filter** option to _apply_ (not calculate) in position or elevation only.

**New bend smoother filter** - four point external centroid (convex only, not 'S').

**Terrain**. Perhaps with quadtree.

With Quadtree, **LIDAR** may be possible. 
(Assuming we leave the data acquisition to the user?)

New tool to **limit gradients** (range or whole track), retaining elevation of marked points.
(There are options. None are perfect, but we can be easier to use than competition.)

Flythrough respects any azimuth & elevation applied when stationery.

One useful elevation tab tool might be the ability to apply a slope difference to a range of points.

Working offline?

Beware bounding box on tracks crossing the international date line !!
