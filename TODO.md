TODO: Usage logging calls.

TODO: Previews for Nudge and Bend on the map. (Support is in JS already.)

**Graph** - the thing that kicked it all off. 
a) Applying edits to canonical graph.
b) Turning it back into a route.
c) DSL for re-routing (including turn-arounds).

-- 2.0.0 ships here --

A: **New bend smoother filter** - four point external centroid (convex only, not 'S').

B: New tool to **limit gradients** (range or whole track), retaining elevation of marked points.
(There are options. None are perfect, but we can be easier to use than competition.)

C: Working offline?

D: Beware bounding box on tracks crossing the international date line !!

E: One useful elevation tab tool might be the ability to apply a slope difference to a range of points.
