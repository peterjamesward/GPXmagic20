1. Basic structures and operations. Keep it simple.
2. Populate and test. (Parse GPX.)
3. All trackpoint derivations in one pass.
3. Simple rendering.
4. Rendering with variable detail. (Just try using modulo.)
5. Multiple views. (Dynamically sized WebGL holes?)
6. Graph by default. (Simple out and back falls out.)
7. Message wrappers for edit messages.
