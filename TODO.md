# BUGS

Map click not good. May be that first click is centering, then second message has wrong coords????


Apply Limit Gradient at 15% - still Steep Climbs showing (Jebal Jais).
(Possibly just rounding.)

Marker position after Simplify is bad.

# TODO

Common track splitter for all edits - return three segments (prior, active, after).

LIDAR?

Flythrough to respect any azimuth & elevation applied when stationery.

One useful elevation tab tool might be the ability to apply a slope difference to a range of points.

Working offline? (Mongoose server?)
