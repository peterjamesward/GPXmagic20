Possible splicing error centroid average filter. Adding at the start??

# TODO

One useful elevation tab tool might be the ability to apply a slope difference to a range of points.

? New bend smoother filter - four point external centroid (convex only, not 'S').

With Quadtree, **LIDAR** may be possible. 
(Assuming we leave the data acquisition to the user?)

Flythrough to respect any azimuth & elevation applied when stationery.

Working offline?

Beware bounding box on tracks crossing the international date line !!

Sun should be in the North at southern latitudes. Could make it moveable. Idle waste of time.
