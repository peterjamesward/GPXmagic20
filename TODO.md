# TODO

Consider colouring TP by curvature.
This may lead to way of identifying (e.g.) sweeping bends, straights, hairpins.
That might then lead to more intelligent automated smoothing, specialised by region.

Strava segment blend elevation rather than just Paste (optional).

? Flythrough to respect any azimuth & elevation applied when stationery.

"One useful elevation tab tool might be the ability to apply a slope difference to a range of points."
(I don't understand this suggestion.)

# Not doing

Working offline? (Mongoose server?)

Touch screen? No.

LIDAR? No.
