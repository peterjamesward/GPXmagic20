# BUGS

Apply Limit Gradient at 15% - still Steep Climbs showing (Jebal Jais).
(Possibly just rounding.)

Marker position after Simplify is bad.

# TODO

Terrain that places road on a mesh, recursivly sub-divided, so quad-tree like.
Mesh => Triangles. Like what we do now, but using the road, not points, to set the elevation.

Common track splitter for all edits - return three segments (prior, active, after).

LIDAR?

Flythrough to respect any azimuth & elevation applied when stationery.

One useful elevation tab tool might be the ability to apply a slope difference to a range of points.

Working offline? (Mongoose server?)
