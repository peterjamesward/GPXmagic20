**BUG**  Bearings are wrong !! This is fairly obvious. They are from X axis!!

**BUG**  Bend problem at 0 on Mount Coot-tha. (!!)

**BUG**  Problems update inconsistently. Esp after Autofix.

**Autofix** seems to make the Flythrough look behind -- suspect road vector derivation.

**Graph** - the thing that kicked it all off.

**New bend smoother filter** - four point external centroid (convex only, not 'S').

**DSL** for navigating the graph ("tulips" for directions, heading?)
Convert from Graph is snafu'd.

Option to limit gradients (range or whole track), retaining elevation of marked points.
(There are options. None are perfect, but we can be easier to use than competition.)

Working offline?

!! Beware bounding box on tracks crossing the international date line !!

Consider allowing for more than one open GPX track.
(For super advanced graph stitching.)
