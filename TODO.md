# BUGS

Apply Limit Gradient at 15% - still Steep Climbs showing (Jebal Jais).
(Possibly just rounding.)

# TODO

Simplified tool accordion. But which tools?
* Gradient/Bend problems + autofix
* Gradient limiter
* New Bezier with no settings
* Delete
* Centroid avg 100%
* Tip Jar

Common track splitter for all edits - return three segments (prior, active, after).

LIDAR?

Flythrough to respect any azimuth & elevation applied when stationery.

One useful elevation tab tool might be the ability to apply a slope difference to a range of points.

Working offline? (Mongoose server?)
