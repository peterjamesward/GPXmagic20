**BUG**: Current point needs to move after Delete single point.

**BUG**: Nudge preview still shows when Tab closed.

**BUG**: Can't Undo graph create.

**Graph** - the thing that kicked it all off. 
_DONE_ a) Applying edits to canonical graph.
_DONE_ b) Turning it back into a route.

c) DSL for re-routing (including turn-arounds ??).
Try re-purposing the Plan view with a column that lists Traversals.
(More likely a derivation of ScenePainterPlan.)
Button to delete from end. Click on Plan to add Edge.
Needs some human-readable edge labelling. 
(Length might do as a stand-in. "Forward 383m to point 57", say.)

-- 2.1.0 ships here --

Flythrough respects any azimuth & elevation applied when stationery.

Terrain. Perhaps with quadtree.

**New bend smoother filter** - four point external centroid (convex only, not 'S').

New tool to **limit gradients** (range or whole track), retaining elevation of marked points.
(There are options. None are perfect, but we can be easier to use than competition.)

One useful elevation tab tool might be the ability to apply a slope difference to a range of points.

Working offline?

Beware bounding box on tracks crossing the international date line !!
