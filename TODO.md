Strava segment blend elevation rather than just Paste (optional).

Bezier approximation should respect markers.

Touch screen? No.

LIDAR? No.

? Flythrough to respect any azimuth & elevation applied when stationery.

One useful elevation tab tool might be the ability to apply a slope difference to a range of points.

Working offline? (Mongoose server?)
