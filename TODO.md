Report GPX parse errors, eg no elevation.

One-click quick-fix.
    - If IRL, Simplify until mean density < some value
    - Interpolate to 10m spacing, say
    - Centroid x N, N = 3?
    - Write with same file (OS will append -1)

STUFF FOR STEVE

    Prep:
        Send relevant Options through with Msg.
        Save the Msg in the Undo list.
    
    Track splitter:
        1. Split track into selected number of equal sections

    Track combiner:
        Appends new track to current
    
    Batch operation:
        1. Define list of (whole track) operations
        2. Apply over directory
        3. Appends if possible when less than theshold distance remains.

Strava segment blend elevation rather than just Paste (optional).

Bezier approximation should respect markers.

? Flythrough to respect any azimuth & elevation applied when stationery.

One useful elevation tab tool might be the ability to apply a slope difference to a range of points.

Working offline? (Mongoose server?)

# Not doing

Touch screen? No.

LIDAR? No.
